## What makes a great pull request?

To ensure your contributions can be reviewed and merged efficiently, please focus on the following to help us merge your changes quickly:

- **Clarity**: Describe the problem you are solving and the approach you took in the PR description. 
- **Purpose**: Ensure your PR has a clear, singular goal. If you are fixing multiple unrelated issues, please submit separate pull requests.
- **Testing**: Whenever possible, include tests that cover your new code or reproduce the bug you are fixing.
- **History**: Use separate commits, ordered logically, to make it easier for others to review your PR.
- **Documentation**: If your change affects users or other developers, please update the relevant documentation as part of your PR.

For an example of exactly what we look for when contributing, please see this [reference PR](https://github.com/genkit-ai/docsite/pull/10)

## Contribution process

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on using pull requests.

Once you submit your PR, a maintainer will review it. If it doesn't meet the guidelines, we may drop a standard reply asking you to update the PR. We will also add a tag to surface that the PR has been reviewed. If there is no response in 2 weeks, we will close the PR as stale with a note to file a new PR under the guidelines if you are still experiencing the issue.
