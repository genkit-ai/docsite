# SEO Indexing Investigation - Genkit Documentation Site

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Issue:** Only genkit.dev/ and genkit.dev/get-started/ are being indexed by Google Search  
**Status:** Investigation Complete - Root Causes Identified  

## Problem Statement

The Genkit documentation site is experiencing severe SEO indexing issues where Google Search Console shows most pages as "Page is not indexed: Crawled - currently not indexed". Only the homepage and get-started page are successfully indexed, despite the site having extensive documentation content.

## Context Provided

- **Deployment:** Firebase Hosting
- **Framework:** Astro with Starlight
- **Sitemap:** Using Astro's built-in sitemap generation
- **Language System:** Multi-language support (JavaScript, Go, Python) with client-side filtering
- **Google Search Console Error:** "URL is not on Google" - "This page is not indexed. Pages that aren't indexed can't be served on Google."

## Investigation Findings

### 1. Sitemap Generation Analysis - HYPOTHESIS DISPROVEN

**Current State:**
- Sitemap index contains one sitemap file (`sitemap-0.xml`) - **This is normal and correct**
- The sitemap file contains **comprehensive URLs** for all documentation pages
- All major documentation sections are properly included: `/docs/models/`, `/docs/flows/`, `/docs/integrations/`, etc.

**Evidence:**
```xml
<!-- sitemap-0.xml contains all expected URLs -->
<url><loc>https://genkit.dev/docs/models/</loc></url>
<url><loc>https://genkit.dev/docs/flows/</loc></url>
<url><loc>https://genkit.dev/docs/integrations/openai/</loc></url>
<!-- ... and many more -->
```

**Key Finding:** The sitemap generation is working correctly. Google can find all the documentation pages. However, the sitemap only contains default language URLs (e.g., `/docs/models/`) and no language-specific variants (e.g., `/docs/models.go`), which suggests the dynamic route system may not be generating separate static pages for each language.

**Conclusion:** Sitemap generation is NOT the primary issue. The problem occurs when Google crawls these properly listed URLs.

### 2. Language Filtering System Analysis - HYPOTHESIS DISPROVEN

**Current Implementation:**
- Content is actually **fully rendered server-side** and visible to crawlers
- All language variants (JavaScript, Go, Python) are present in the HTML source
- The `LanguageContent` component wraps each language section but doesn't hide content from crawlers

**Evidence from models.mdx:**
```html
<LanguageContent lang="js">
  <!-- 870+ lines of JavaScript documentation content -->
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="go">
  <!-- 540+ lines of Go documentation content -->
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="python">
  <!-- 370+ lines of Python documentation content -->
</LanguageContent>
```

**Key Finding:** The language filtering system is working correctly for SEO. All content is server-side rendered and accessible to search crawlers. The CSS hiding only affects client-side display, not the HTML source that crawlers see.

**Conclusion:** Language filtering is NOT preventing Google from seeing content. The issue must be elsewhere.

### 3. Client-Side Content Rendering

**Current Architecture:**
- Language switching is entirely client-side
- Critical documentation content is filtered after page load
- No server-side rendering of language-specific content
- Pages appear empty to search engines that don't execute JavaScript

### 4. Missing SEO Fundamentals

**Identified Gaps:**
- No canonical URLs for language variants
- Missing hreflang tags for multilingual content
- No structured data markup
- Language-specific pages lack proper meta descriptions
- No proper handling of language variants in sitemap

## Technical Analysis

### Dynamic Route System
The `src/pages/[...slug].md.ts` file generates multiple paths per content entry:
- Default path (JavaScript): `/docs/models/`
- Language-specific paths: `/docs/models.js`, `/docs/models.go`, `/docs/models.python`

However, these language-specific routes may not be properly surfaced to Astro's sitemap generation.

### Language Content Component
```astro
<!-- src/components/LanguageContent.astro -->
<div class="lang-content" data-lang={langAttribute}>
  <slot />
</div>
```

Combined with CSS that hides all content by default:
```css
.lang-content {
  display: none !important;
  visibility: hidden !important;
}
```

This creates an SEO black hole where crawlers see no content.

## Root Cause Analysis ‚úÖ CONFIRMED

### Critical Discovery: Domain Authority Migration Issues

**Key Evidence from Google Search Console:**
- **156 pages NOT indexed** across 4 different issue types
- **Only 1 page indexed** (homepage)
- **144 pages: "Crawled - currently not indexed"** - the main problem
- **Migration Context:** Site moved from `firebase.google.com/docs/genkit` to `genkit.dev`

### The Real Problem: "Crawled - Currently Not Indexed"

This Google Search Console status indicates:
- ‚úÖ **Technical Setup Works:** Google can access and crawl pages
- ‚úÖ **No Blocking Issues:** No robots.txt or technical barriers
- ‚ùå **Quality/Authority Signals:** Google chooses NOT to index due to perceived low value
- ‚ùå **New Domain Penalty:** `genkit.dev` lacks the authority of `firebase.google.com`

### Domain Authority Migration Impact

**Before Migration:**
- `firebase.google.com` = Massive domain authority and trust
- Google readily indexed content on this high-authority domain

**After Migration:**
- `genkit.dev` = New domain with zero established authority
- Google questions: "Why index content on an unproven domain?"
- 301 redirects help but don't transfer full authority immediately

### Content Duplication Hypothesis - DISPROVEN

**Initial Theory:** Massive content duplication across language variants causing indexing issues.

**Counter-Evidence:**
- **MCP Server page** (`/docs/mcp-server/`) has clean, unique content without duplication
- **MCP Server page is still NOT indexed** despite having no duplication issues
- **Content quality varies** but indexing problems are universal across all pages

**Conclusion:** Content duplication is not the primary cause. Even high-quality, unique pages aren't being indexed.

### Technical SEO Issues Identified

From Google Search Console breakdown:
1. **"Duplicate without user-selected canonical" (1 page)** - Missing canonical tags
2. **"Page with redirect" (2 pages)** - Redirect configuration issues
3. **"Excluded by 'noindex' tag" (9 pages)** - Pages explicitly blocked from indexing
4. **"Crawled - currently not indexed" (144 pages)** - Main authority/quality issue

## Comprehensive Solution Strategy

### Phase 1: Technical SEO Fixes (Week 1-2) üö® CRITICAL

#### 1.1 Canonical Tags Implementation
**Problem:** "Duplicate without user-selected canonical" affecting 1 page
**Solution:** Add canonical tags to all documentation pages

```astro
<!-- Add to src/content/custom/head.astro -->
<link rel="canonical" href={Astro.url.href} />
```

#### 1.2 Meta Robots Optimization
**Problem:** 9 pages excluded by 'noindex' tag
**Solution:** Review and fix noindex directives

```astro
<!-- Ensure proper indexing for documentation pages -->
<meta name="robots" content="index, follow" />
```

#### 1.3 Structured Data Implementation
**Problem:** Google lacks context about content type and structure
**Solution:** Add JSON-LD structured data for documentation

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "TechArticle",
  "headline": "Page Title",
  "description": "Page Description",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Google"
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Firebase Authority Transfer (Week 1-2) üöÄ HIGHEST IMPACT

**If you control firebase.google.com/docs/genkit, this is your biggest opportunity!**

#### Strategic Internal Linking
```html
<!-- Add to firebase.google.com/docs/genkit pages -->
<div class="migration-notice">
  <p>üìç <strong>Genkit documentation has moved!</strong></p>
  <p>Find the latest guides at <a href="https://genkit.dev/docs/">genkit.dev</a></p>
</div>
```

#### Authority-Passing Links
- Add genkit.dev links to Firebase docs navigation
- Include contextual cross-references throughout Firebase documentation
- Publish Firebase blog posts linking to genkit.dev

### Phase 3: Authority Building (Week 3-8) üìà HIGH PRIORITY

- Missing structured data markup

## Strategic Documents Created

1. **SEO-IMPROVEMENT-STRATEGY.md** - Comprehensive implementation roadmap
2. **FIREBASE-AUTHORITY-TRANSFER-STRATEGY.md** - High-impact Firebase linking strategy

## Conclusion

The indexing issues are primarily caused by **domain authority migration challenges** rather than technical SEO problems. The solution requires:

1. **Technical SEO fixes** (canonical tags, structured data) - Week 1-2
2. **Firebase authority transfer** (strategic linking) - Week 1-2 üöÄ HIGHEST IMPACT
3. **Authority building** (internal linking, content signals) - Ongoing
4. **Time and patience** for domain authority to develop

**Expected Outcome:** With Firebase authority transfer strategy, indexing improvements should be visible within 4-6 weeks instead of 4-6 months.
