_Tool calling_, also known as _function calling_, is a structured way to give
LLMs the ability to make requests back to the application that called it. You
define the tools you want to make available to the model, and the model will
make tool requests to your app as necessary to fulfill the prompts you give it.

The use cases of tool calling generally fall into a few themes:

**Giving an LLM access to information it wasn't trained with**

- Frequently changing information, such as a stock price or the current
  weather.
- Information specific to your app domain, such as product information or user
  profiles.

Note the overlap with [retrieval augmented generation](/docs/rag) (RAG), which is also
a way to let an LLM integrate factual information into its generations. RAG is a
heavier solution that is most suited when you have a large amount of information
or the information that's most relevant to a prompt is ambiguous. On the other
hand, if retrieving the information the LLM needs is a simple function call or
database lookup, tool calling is more appropriate.

**Introducing a degree of determinism into an LLM workflow**

- Performing calculations that the LLM cannot reliably complete itself.
- Forcing an LLM to generate verbatim text under certain circumstances, such
  as when responding to a question about an app's terms of service.

**Performing an action when initiated by an LLM**

- Turning on and off lights in an LLM-powered home assistant
- Reserving table reservations in an LLM-powered restaurant agent

## Before you begin

If you want to run the code examples on this page, first complete the steps in
the [Getting started](/docs/get-started) guide. All of the examples assume that you
have already set up a project with Genkit dependencies installed.

This page discusses one of the advanced features of Genkit model abstraction, so
before you dive too deeply, you should be familiar with the content on the
[Generating content with AI models](/docs/models) page. You should also be familiar
with Genkit's system for defining input and output schemas, which is discussed
on the [Flows](/docs/flows) page.

## Overview of tool calling

<ExampleLink

  description="See how Genkit can enable rich UI for tool calling in a live demo."
  example="tool-calling"
/>

At a high level, this is what a typical tool-calling interaction with an LLM
looks like:

1. The calling application prompts the LLM with a request and also includes in
   the prompt a list of tools the LLM can use to generate a response.
2. The LLM either generates a complete response or generates a tool call request
   in a specific format.
3. If the caller receives a complete response, the request is fulfilled and the
   interaction ends; but if the caller receives a tool call, it performs
   whatever logic is appropriate and sends a new request to the LLM containing
   the original prompt or some variation of it as well as the result of the tool
   call.
4. The LLM handles the new prompt as in Step 2.

For this to work, several requirements must be met:

- The model must be trained to make tool requests when it's needed to complete
  a prompt. Most of the larger models provided through web APIs, such as
  Gemini and Claude, can do this, but smaller and more specialized models
  often cannot. Genkit will throw an error if you try to provide tools to a
  model that doesn't support it.
- The calling application must provide tool definitions to the model in the
  format it expects.
- The calling application must prompt the model to generate tool calling
  requests in the format the application expects.

## Tool calling with Genkit

Genkit provides a single interface for tool calling with models that support it.
Each model plugin ensures that the last two of the above criteria are met, and
the Genkit instance's `generate()` function automatically carries out the tool
calling loop described earlier.

### Model support

Tool calling support depends on the model, the model API, and the Genkit plugin.
Consult the relevant documentation to determine if tool calling is likely to be
supported. In addition:

- Genkit will throw an error if you try to provide tools to a model that
  doesn't support it.
- If the plugin exports model references, the `info.supports.tools` property
  will indicate if it supports tool calling.

### Defining tools

Use the Genkit instance's `defineTool()` function to write tool definitions:

```ts
import { genkit, z } from 'genkit';
import { googleAI } from '@genkitai/google-ai';

const ai = genkit({
  plugins: [googleAI()],
  model: googleAI.model('gemini-2.0-flash'),
});

const getWeather = ai.defineTool(
  {
    name: 'getWeather',
    description: 'Gets the current weather in a given location',
    inputSchema: z.object({
      location: z.string().describe('The location to get the current weather for'),
    }),
    outputSchema: z.string(),
  },
  async (input) => {
    // Here, we would typically make an API call or database query. For this
    // example, we just return a fixed value.
    return `The current weather in ${input.location} is 63Â°F and sunny.`;
  },
);
```

The syntax here looks just like the `defineFlow()` syntax; however, `name`,
`description`, and `inputSchema` parameters are required. When writing a tool
definition, take special care with the wording and descriptiveness of these
parameters. They are vital for the LLM to make effective use of the
available tools.

### Using tools

Include defined tools in your prompts to generate content.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Generate">
    ```ts
    const response = await ai.generate({
      prompt: "What is the weather in Baltimore?",
      tools: [getWeather],
    });
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="definePrompt">
    ```ts
    const weatherPrompt = ai.definePrompt(
      {
        name: "weatherPrompt",
        tools: [getWeather],
      },
      "What is the weather in {{location}}?"
    );

    const response = await weatherPrompt({ location: "Baltimore" });
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Prompt file">
    ```dotprompt
    ---
    tools: [getWeather]
    input:
      schema:
        location: string
    ---

    What is the weather in {{location}}?
    ```

    Then you can execute the prompt in your code as follows:

    ```ts
    // assuming prompt file is named weatherPrompt.prompt
    const weatherPrompt = ai.prompt("weatherPrompt");

    const response = await weatherPrompt({ location: "Baltimore" });
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Chat">
    ```ts
    const chat = ai.chat({
      system: "Answer questions using the tools you have.",
      tools: [getWeather],
    });

    const response = await chat.send("What is the weather in Baltimore?");

    // Or, specify tools that are message-specific
    const response = await chat.send({
      prompt: "What is the weather in Baltimore?",
      tools: [getWeather],
    });
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Limiting Tool Call Iterations with `maxTurns`

When working with tools that might trigger multiple sequential calls, you can control resource usage and prevent runaway execution using the `maxTurns` parameter. This sets a hard limit on how many back-and-forth interactions the model can have with your tools in a single generation cycle.

**Why use maxTurns?**
- **Cost Control**: Prevents unexpected API usage charges from excessive tool calls
- **Performance**: Ensures responses complete within reasonable timeframes
- **Safety**: Guards against infinite loops in complex tool interactions
- **Predictability**: Makes your application behavior more deterministic

The default value is 5 turns, which works well for most scenarios. Each "turn" represents one complete cycle where the model can make tool calls and receive responses.

**Example: Web Research Agent**

Consider a research agent that might need to search multiple times to find comprehensive information:

```ts
const webSearch = ai.defineTool(
  {
    name: 'webSearch',
    description: 'Search the web for current information',
    inputSchema: z.object({
      query: z.string().describe('Search query'),
    }),
    outputSchema: z.string(),
  },
  async (input) => {
    // Simulate web search API call
    return `Search results for "${input.query}": [relevant information here]`;
  },
);

const response = await ai.generate({
  prompt: 'Research the latest developments in quantum computing, including recent breakthroughs, key companies, and future applications.',
  tools: [webSearch],
  maxTurns: 8, // Allow up to 8 research iterations
});
```

**Example: Financial Calculator**

Here's a more complex scenario where an agent might need multiple calculation steps:

```ts
const calculator = ai.defineTool(
  {
    name: 'calculator',
    description: 'Perform mathematical calculations',
    inputSchema: z.object({
      expression: z.string().describe('Mathematical expression to evaluate'),
    }),
    outputSchema: z.number(),
  },
  async (input) => {
    // Safe evaluation of mathematical expressions
    return eval(input.expression); // In production, use a safe math parser
  },
);

const stockAnalyzer = ai.defineTool(
  {
    name: 'stockAnalyzer',
    description: 'Get current stock price and basic metrics',
    inputSchema: z.object({
      symbol: z.string().describe('Stock symbol (e.g., AAPL)'),
    }),
    outputSchema: z.object({
      price: z.number(),
      change: z.number(),
      volume: z.number(),
    }),
  },
  async (input) => {
    // Simulate stock API call
    return {
      price: 150.25,
      change: 2.50,
      volume: 45000000
    };
  },
);
```

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Generate">
    ```typescript
    const response = await ai.generate({
      prompt: 'Calculate the total value of my portfolio: 100 shares of AAPL, 50 shares of GOOGL, and 200 shares of MSFT. Also calculate what percentage each holding represents.',
      tools: [calculator, stockAnalyzer],
      maxTurns: 12, // Multiple stock lookups + calculations needed
    });
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="definePrompt">
    ```typescript
    const portfolioAnalysisPrompt = ai.definePrompt(
      {
        name: "portfolioAnalysis",
        tools: [calculator, stockAnalyzer],
        maxTurns: 12,
      },
      "Calculate the total value of my portfolio: {{holdings}}. Also calculate what percentage each holding represents."
    );

    const response = await portfolioAnalysisPrompt({ 
      holdings: "100 shares of AAPL, 50 shares of GOOGL, and 200 shares of MSFT" 
    });
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Prompt file">
    ```dotprompt
    ---
    tools: [calculator, stockAnalyzer]
    maxTurns: 12
    input:
      schema:
        holdings: string
    ---

    Calculate the total value of my portfolio: {{holdings}}. Also calculate what percentage each holding represents.
    ```

    Then execute the prompt:

    ```typescript
    const portfolioAnalysisPrompt = ai.prompt("portfolioAnalysis");

    const response = await portfolioAnalysisPrompt({ 
      holdings: "100 shares of AAPL, 50 shares of GOOGL, and 200 shares of MSFT" 
    });
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Chat">
    ```typescript
    const chat = ai.chat({
      system: "You are a financial analysis assistant. Use the available tools to provide accurate calculations and current market data.",
      tools: [calculator, stockAnalyzer],
      maxTurns: 12,
    });

    const response = await chat.send("Calculate the total value of my portfolio: 100 shares of AAPL, 50 shares of GOOGL, and 200 shares of MSFT. Also calculate what percentage each holding represents.");
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**What happens when maxTurns is reached?**

When the limit is hit, Genkit stops the tool-calling loop and returns the model's current response, even if it was in the middle of using tools. The model will typically provide a partial answer or explain that it couldn't complete all the requested operations.

### Dynamically defining tools at runtime

As most things in Genkit tools need to be predefined during your app's
initialization. This is necessary so that you would be able interact with your
tools from the Genkit Dev UI. This is typically the recommended way. However
there are scenarios when the tool must be defined dynamically per user request.

You can dynamically define tools using `ai.dynamicTool` function. It is very
similar to `ai.defineTool` method, however dynamic tools are not tracked by
Genkit runtime, so cannot be interacted with from Genkit Dev UI and must be
passed to the `ai.generate` call by reference (for regular tools you can also
use a string tool name).

```ts
import { genkit, z } from 'genkit';
import { googleAI } from '@genkit-ai/googleai';

const ai = genkit({
  plugins: [googleAI()],
  model: googleAI.model('gemini-2.0-flash'),
});

ai.defineFlow('weatherFlow', async () => {
  const getWeather = ai.dynamicTool(
    {
      name: 'getWeather',
      description: 'Gets the current weather in a given location',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the current weather for'),
      }),
      outputSchema: z.string(),
    },
    async (input) => {
      return `The current weather in ${input.location} is 63Â°F and sunny.`;
    },
  );

  const { text } = await ai.generate({
    prompt: 'What is the weather in Baltimore?',
    tools: [getWeather],
  });

  return text;
});
```

When defining dynamic tools, to specify input and output schemas you can either
use Zod as shown in the previous example, or you can pass in manually
constructed JSON Schema.

```ts
const getWeather = ai.dynamicTool(
  {
    name: 'getWeather',
    description: 'Gets the current weather in a given location',
    inputJsonSchema: myInputJsonSchema,
    outputJsonSchema: myOutputJsonSchema,
  },
  async (input) => {
    /* ... */
  },
);
```

Dynamic tools don't require the implementation function. If you don't pass in
the function the tool will behave like an [interrupt](/docs/interrupts) and you can
do manual tool call handling:

```ts
const getWeather = ai.dynamicTool({
  name: 'getWeather',
  description: 'Gets the current weather in a given location',
  inputJsonSchema: myInputJsonSchema,
  outputJsonSchema: myOutputJsonSchema,
});
```

### Pause the tool loop by using interrupts

By default, Genkit repeatedly calls the LLM until every tool call has been
resolved. You can conditionally pause execution in situations where you want
to, for example:

- Ask the user a question or display UI.
- Confirm a potentially risky action with the user.
- Request out-of-band approval for an action.

**Interrupts** are special tools that can halt the loop and return control
to your code so that you can handle more advanced scenarios. Visit the
[interrupts guide](/docs/interrupts) to learn how to use them.

### Explicitly handling tool calls

If you want full control over this tool-calling loop, for example to
apply more complicated logic, set the `returnToolRequests` parameter to `true`.
Now it's your responsibility to ensure all of the tool requests are fulfilled:

```ts
const getWeather = ai.defineTool(
  {
    // ... tool definition ...
  },
  async ({ location }) => {
    // ... tool implementation ...
  },
);

const generateOptions: GenerateOptions = {
  prompt: "What's the weather like in Baltimore?",
  tools: [getWeather],
  returnToolRequests: true,
};

let llmResponse;
while (true) {
  llmResponse = await ai.generate(generateOptions);
  const toolRequests = llmResponse.toolRequests;
  if (toolRequests.length < 1) {
    break;
  }
  const toolResponses: ToolResponsePart[] = await Promise.all(
    toolRequests.map(async (part) => {
      switch (part.toolRequest.name) {
        case 'specialTool':
          return {
            toolResponse: {
              name: part.toolRequest.name,
              ref: part.toolRequest.ref,
              output: await getWeather(part.toolRequest.input),
            },
          };
        default:
          throw Error('Tool not found');
      }
    }),
  );
  generateOptions.messages = llmResponse.messages;
  generateOptions.prompt = toolResponses;
}
