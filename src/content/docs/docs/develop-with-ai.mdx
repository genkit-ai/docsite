AI assistants rely on up-to-date knowledge of the codebase to effectively write and edit code. If you are using Genkit in your application, it is crucial that the AI assistant has information on what Genkit is, its basic constructs (flows, actions, dotprompt, etc.), and how to run and debug a Genkit application. The Genkit CLI provides a command to help developers configure their AI assistants for Genkit apps.

 The Genkit AI assistant support is experimental and should be used with caution.
</Aside>

## Usage

Genkit offers the `init:ai-tools` command to automate the configuration of your favorite AI assistants to work with Genkit:

```bash
genkit init:ai-tools
```

This command performs the following actions:

- Detects the existing AI assistant configuration to ensure that any changes do not affect existing settings. If no configuration is present, a new configuration file is created.

- Installs the [Genkit MCP server](/docs/mcp-server) to the selected AI assistant. The MCP server provides tools to the AI assistant for understanding and interacting with Genkit:
    -   `lookup_genkit_docs`: Looks up relevant Genkit documentation from https://genkit.dev
    -   `list_flows`: Lists the flows in the current Genkit app.
    -   `run_flow`: Runs a specific flow with a given input.
    -   `get_trace`: Fetches a trace by trace ID, useful for analysis and debugging.

    For more details, please refer to the [Genkit MCP server](/docs/mcp-server) documentation.

- Adds (or updates) the `GENKIT.md` file and incorporates it into the system context for the AI assistant. This Markdown file contains instructions on how to use the Genkit CLI, the Genkit MCP server, and other relevant information to provide a smooth user experience when coding with AI assistants.

### Supported AI Tools

Genkit has built-in support for the following tools:

- [Gemini CLI](https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/gemini-cli)
- [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)
- [Cursor](https://cursor.com/home)

For other tools, you can select the `generic` configuration option during initialization. This will provide a `GENKIT.md` file that you can manually integrate with your preferred AI tool. The following resources provide guidance on configuring popular AI coding environments:


| Environment/IDE | Installation Instructions |
|:----------------|:--------------------------|
| Copilot powered IDEs | <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_custom-instructions" target="_blank">Configure `.github/copilot-instructions.md`</a> |
| JetBrains IDEs  | <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/junie/customize-guidelines.html" target="_blank">Configure `guidelines.md`</a> |
| VS Code | <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_custom-instructions" target="_blank">Configure `.instructions.md`</a> |
| Windsurf | <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/memories#rules" target="_blank">Configure `guidelines.md`</a> |

### Custom Instructions

The `GENKIT.md` file contains the custom instructions that guide the AI in generating Genkit-specific code. If you need to customize this further or use it in a different context, you can copy the content and apply it to your tool's instruction set.

import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import importedCode from '/public/genkit.md?raw';
