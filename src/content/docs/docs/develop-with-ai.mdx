AI assistants need up-to-date knowledge of your codebase to be effective. When working with Genkit, your AI assistant must understand Genkit's core concepts (flows, actions, dotprompt, etc.) and how to run and debug your application. The Genkit CLI provides a command to help you configure your AI assistant for this purpose.

 Genkit AI assistant support is experimental and may change without notice.

## Usage

Genkit offers the `init:ai-tools` command to automate the configuration of your favorite AI assistants to work with Genkit:

```bash
genkit init:ai-tools
```

This command performs the following actions:

- Detects the existing AI assistant configuration to ensure that any changes do not affect existing settings. If no configuration is present, a new one is created.

- Installs the [Genkit MCP server](/docs/mcp-server) for the selected AI assistant. The MCP server provides tools to help the assistant understand and interact with Genkit:
    -   `get_usage_guide`: Looks up a detailed Genkit usage guide for a given language. Intended for AI assistants. 
    -   `lookup_genkit_docs`: Looks up relevant Genkit documentation from https://genkit.dev
    -   `list_flows`: Lists the flows in the current Genkit app.
    -   `run_flow`: Runs a specific flow with a given input.
    -   `get_trace`: Fetches a trace by ID, which is useful for analysis and debugging.

    For more details, please refer to the [Genkit MCP server](/docs/mcp-server) documentation.

- Adds or updates the `GENKIT.md` file and incorporates it into the AI assistant's system context. This file contains instructions on using the Genkit CLI and the Genkit MCP server, and other information to streamline development with AI assistants.

### Supported AI Tools

#### Gemini CLI

Genkit supports two ways of integrating with Gemini CLI:

 - `GEMINI.md` file: You can use the `init:ai-tools` command to set up Genkit context using a `.md` file. This will add a new section to your `GEMINI.md` file with Genkit context. This file is installed at the workspace level, making it ideal for providing project-level support. 

 - Gemini CLI extension: Genkit has an official [Gemini CLI extension](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/genkit) that can be installed using the Gemini CLI:

    ```bash
    gemini extensions install https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/genkit
    ``` 

    This integrates natively with Gemini CLI and can be managed using the `gemini extensions` [commands](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/extension.md), including automatic updates. 

    Gemini extensions are installed at the user level; they are applicable to all Gemini CLI sessions for the current user and are curated to be applicable to a broad range of scenarios and projects. 

    :::note
    The Genkit extension for Gemini CLI requires that you have `npx` installed to be fully functional.

#### Other integrators

`genkit init:ai-tools` also has built-in support for the following tools:

- [Firebase Studio](https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio)
- [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)
- [Cursor](https://cursor.com/home)

For other tools, you can select the `generic` configuration option in `init:ai-tools` command. This will provide a `GENKIT.md` file that you can manually integrate with your preferred AI tool. The following resources provide guidance on configuring popular AI coding environments:

### Tips for using AI assistants with Genkit

AI assistants are powerful tools, but they can sometimes make mistakes. Follow these tips to ensure a smooth experience when using an AI assistant with Genkit:

- **Provide guidance**: Ask your assistant to consult the usage guide and documentation, especially if it seems to be generating incorrect or outdated code.
- **Manage `genkit start` correctly**: If your assistant attempts to run the `genkit start` command, cancel the request. Running this command within the assistant's environment can block its main thread. Instead, run `genkit start` in a separate terminal.

### Custom Instructions

The `GENKIT.md` file contains the custom instructions that guide the AI in generating Genkit-specific code. If you need to customize this further or use it in a different context, you can copy the content and apply it to your tool's instruction set.
