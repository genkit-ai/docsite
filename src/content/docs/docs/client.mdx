description: Learn how to access Genkit flows from client-side applications.
---

There are two primary ways to access Genkit flows from client-side applications:
 - Using the Genkit client library
 - Cloud Functions for Firebase callable function client SDK

## Using the Genkit client library

You can call your deployed flows using the Genkit client library. This library provides functions for both non-streaming and streaming flow calls. See "Call your flows from the client" in [Deploy flows to any Node.js platform](/docs/deploy-node) for more details.

### Non-streaming Flow Calls

For a non-streaming response, use the `runFlow` function. This is suitable for flows that return a single, complete output.

```typescript
import { runFlow } from 'genkit/beta/client';

async function callHelloFlow() {
  try {
    const result = await runFlow({
      url: 'http://127.0.0.1:3400/helloFlow', // Replace with your deployed flow's URL
      input: { name: 'Genkit User' },
    });
    console.log('Non-streaming result:', result.greeting);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error calling helloFlow:', error);
  }
}

callHelloFlow();
```

### Streaming Flow Calls

For flows that are designed to stream responses (e.g., for real-time updates or long-running operations), use the `streamFlow` function.

```typescript
import { streamFlow } from 'genkit/beta/client';

async function streamHelloFlow() {
  try {
    const result = streamFlow({
      url: 'http://127.0.0.1:3400/helloFlow', // Replace with your deployed flow's URL
      input: { name: 'Streaming User' },
    });

    // Process the stream chunks as they arrive
    for await (const chunk of result.stream) {
      console.log('Stream chunk:', chunk);
    }

    // Get the final complete response
    const finalOutput = await result.output;
    console.log('Final streaming output:', finalOutput.greeting);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error streaming helloFlow:', error);
  }
}

streamHelloFlow();
```

### Authentication (Optional)

If your deployed flow requires authentication, you can pass headers with your requests:

```typescript
const result = await runFlow({
  url: 'http://127.0.0.1:3400/helloFlow', // Replace with your deployed flow's URL
  headers: {
    Authorization: 'Bearer your-token-here', // Replace with your actual token
  },
  input: { name: 'Authenticated User' },
});
```

## When deploying to Cloud Functions for Firebase

When deploying to [Cloud Functions for Firebase](/docs/firebase), use the Firebase callable functions client library.

Detailed documentation can be found at https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/callable?gen=2nd

Here's a sample for the web:

```typescript
// Get the callable by passing an initialized functions SDK.
const getForecast = httpsCallable(functions, "getForecast");

// Call the function with the `.stream()` method to start streaming.
const { stream, data } = await getForecast.stream({
  locations: favoriteLocations,
});

// The `stream` async iterable returned by `.stream()`
// will yield a new value every time the callable
// function calls `sendChunk()`.
for await (const forecastDataChunk of stream) {
  // update the UI every time a new chunk is received
  // from the callable function
  updateUi(forecastDataChunk);
}

// The `data` promise resolves when the callable
// function completes.
const allWeatherForecasts = await data;
finalizeUi(allWeatherForecasts);
```
