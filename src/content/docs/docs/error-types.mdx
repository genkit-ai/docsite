Genkit Dart SDK uses a unified `GenkitException` class for error handling. 
This exception interacts closely with the `StatusCodes` enum to provide semantically meaningful error reporting across plugin boundaries and RPC responses.

`GenkitException` is intended to be used by both the framework and user code. 
When an exception includes a specific status code (e.g., `StatusCodes.invalidArgument` or `StatusCodes.notFound`), it helps Genkit tools and observability systems to categorize the failure correctly.

All other exceptions caught by the framework are automatically wrapped or treated as internal errors with `StatusCodes.internal` to prevent implementation details from leaking in production responses.

Genkit knows about two specialized types: `GenkitError` and `UserFacingError`.
`GenkitError` is intended for use by Genkit itself or Genkit plugins.
`UserFacingError` is intended for [`ContextProviders`](/docs/deployment/authorization) and
your code. The separation between these two error types helps you better understand
where your error is coming from.

Genkit plugins for web hosting (e.g. [`@genkit-ai/express`](https://js.api.genkit.dev/modules/_genkit-ai_express.html) or [`@genkit-ai/next`](https://js.api.genkit.dev/modules/_genkit-ai_next.html))
SHOULD capture all other Error types and instead report them as an internal error in the response.
This adds a layer of security to your application by ensuring that internal details of your application
do not leak to attackers.
