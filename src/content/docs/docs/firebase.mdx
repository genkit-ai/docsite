title: Deploy flows using Cloud Functions for Firebase
---

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Cloud Functions for Firebase has an `onCallGenkit` method that lets you
quickly create a [callable function](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/callable?gen=2nd)
with a Genkit action (e.g. a Flow). These functions can be called using
`genkit/beta/client`or the [Functions client SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/callable?gen=2nd#call_the_function),
which automatically adds auth info.

## Before you begin

- You should be familiar with Genkit's concept of [flows](/docs/flows), and how to
  write them. The instructions on this page assume that you already have some
  flows defined, which you want to deploy.
- It would be helpful, but not required, if you've already used Cloud
  Functions for Firebase before.

## 1. Set up a Firebase project

If you don't already have a Firebase project with TypeScript Cloud Functions set
up, follow these steps:

1.  Create a new Firebase project using the [Firebase
    console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) or choose an existing one.

1.  Upgrade the project to the Blaze plan, which is required to deploy Cloud
    Functions.

1.  Install the [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli).

1.  Log in with the Firebase CLI:

    ```bash
    firebase login

    firebase login --reauth # alternative, if necessary

    firebase login --no-localhost # if running in a remote shell
    ```

1.  Create a new project directory:

    ```bash
    export PROJECT_ROOT=~/tmp/genkit-firebase-project1

    mkdir -p $PROJECT_ROOT
    ```

1.  Initialize a Firebase project in the directory:

    ```bash
    cd $PROJECT_ROOT

    firebase init genkit
    ```

    The rest of this page assumes that you've decided to write your functions
    in TypeScript, but you can also deploy your Genkit flows if you're using
    JavaScript.

## 2. Wrap the Flow in onCallGenkit

After you've set up a Firebase project with Cloud Functions, you can copy or
write flow definitions in the projectâ€™s `functions/src` directory, and export
them in `index.ts`.

For your flows to be deployable, you need to wrap them in `onCallGenkit`.
This method has all the features of the normal `onCall`. It automatically
supports both streaming and JSON responses.

Suppose you have the following flow:

```ts
const generatePoemFlow = ai.defineFlow(
  {
    name: 'generatePoem',
    inputSchema: z.string(),
    outputSchema: z.string(),
  },
  async (subject: string) => {
    const { text } = await ai.generate(`Compose a poem about ${subject}.`);
    return text;
  },
);
```

You can expose this flow as a callable function using `onCallGenkit`:

```ts
import { onCallGenkit } from 'firebase-functions/https';

export generatePoem = onCallGenkit(generatePoemFlow);
```

### Define an authorization policy

All deployed flows, whether deployed to Firebase or not, should have an
authorization policy; without one, anyone can invoke your potentially-expensive
generative AI flows. To define an authorization policy, use the
`authPolicy` parameter of `onCallGenkit`:

```ts
export const generatePoem = onCallGenkit(
  {
    authPolicy: (auth) => auth?.token?.email_verified,
  },
  generatePoemFlow,
);
```

This sample uses a manual function as its auth policy. In addition, the https
library exports the `signedIn()` and `hasClaim()` helpers. Here is the same code
using one of those helpers:

```ts
import { hasClaim } from 'firebase-functions/https';

export const generatePoem = onCallGenkit(
  {
    authPolicy: hasClaim('email_verified'),
  },
  generatePoemFlow,
);
```

### Make API credentials available to deployed flows

Once deployed, your flows need some way to authenticate with any remote services
they rely on. Most flows need, at a minimum, credentials for accessing the
model API service they use.

For this example, do one of the following, depending on the model provider you chose:

<Tabs syncKey="model-provider">
  <TabItem label="Gemini (Google AI)">
    1.  Make sure Google AI is [available in your region](https://ai.google.dev/available_regions).

    2.  [Generate an API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) for the
        Gemini API using Google AI Studio.

    3.  Store your API key in Cloud Secret Manager:

        ```bash
        firebase functions:secrets:set GEMINI_API_KEY
        ```

        This step is important to prevent accidentally leaking your API key,
        which grants access to a potentially metered service.

        See [Store and access sensitive configuration information](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/config-env?gen=2nd#secret-manager)
        for more information on managing secrets.

    4.  Edit `src/index.ts` and add the following after the existing imports:

        ```ts
        import { defineSecret } from "firebase-functions/params";
        const googleAIapiKey = defineSecret("GEMINI_API_KEY");
        ```

        Then, in the flow definition, declare that the cloud function needs
        access to this secret value:

        ```ts
        export const generatePoem = onCallGenkit(
          {
            secrets: [googleAIapiKey],
          },
          generatePoemFlow
        );
        ```

    Now, when you deploy this function, your API key is stored in Cloud Secret Manager, and available from the Cloud Functions environment.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Gemini (Vertex AI)">
    1.  In the Cloud console, [Enable the Vertex AI API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/aiplatform.googleapis.com?project=_)
        for your Firebase project.

    2.  On the [IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam?project=_)
        page, ensure that the **Default compute service account** is granted the
        **Vertex AI User** role.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The only secret you need to set up for this tutorial is for the model provider,
but in general, you must do something similar for each service your flow uses.

### Add App Check enforcement

[Firebase App Check](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-check) uses a
built-in attestation mechanism to verify that your API is only being called by
your application. `onCallGenkit` supports App Check enforcement declaratively.

```ts
export const generatePoem = onCallGenkit(
  {
    enforceAppCheck: true,
    // Optional. Makes App Check tokens only usable once. This adds extra security
    // at the expense of slowing down your app to generate a token for every API
    // call
    consumeAppCheckToken: true,
  },
  generatePoemFlow,
);
```

### Set a CORS policy

Callable functions default to allowing any domain to call your function. If you
want to customize the domains that can do this, use the `cors` option.
With proper authentication (especially App Check), CORS is often unnecessary.

```ts
export const generatePoem = onCallGenkit(
  {
    cors: 'mydomain.com',
  },
  generatePoemFlow,
);
```

### Complete example

After you've made all of the changes described earlier, your deployable flow
looks something like the following example:

```ts
import { genkit } from 'genkit';
import { googleAI } from '@genkit-ai/googleai';
import { onCallGenkit, hasClaim } from 'firebase-functions/https';
import { defineSecret } from 'firebase-functions/params';

const apiKey = defineSecret('GEMINI_API_KEY');

const ai = genkit({
  plugins: [googleAI()],
  model: googleAI.model('gemini-2.5-flash'),
});

const generatePoemFlow = ai.defineFlow(
  {
    name: 'generatePoem',
    inputSchema: z.string(),
    outputSchema: z.string(),
  },
  async (subject: string) => {
    const { text } = await ai.generate(`Compose a poem about ${subject}.`);
    return text;
  },
);

export const generateFlow = onCallGenkit(
  {
    secrets: [apiKey],
    authPolicy: hasClaim('email_verified'),
    enforceAppCheck: true,
  },
  generatePoemFlow,
);
```

## 3. Deploy flows to Firebase

After you've defined flows using `onCallGenkit`, you can deploy them the same
way you would deploy other Cloud Functions:

```bash
cd $PROJECT_ROOT

firebase deploy --only functions
```

You've now deployed the flow as a Cloud Function! But you can't
access your deployed endpoint with `curl` or similar, because of the flow's
authorization policy. The next section explains how to securely access the
flow.

## Optional: Try the deployed flow

To try out your flow endpoint, you can deploy the following minimal example web
app:

1.  In the [Project settings](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/general)
    section of the Firebase console, add a new web app, selecting the option to
    also set up Hosting.

1.  In the
    [Authentication](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers)
    section of the Firebase console, enable the **Google** provider, used in
    this example.

1.  In your project directory, set up Firebase Hosting, where you will deploy
    the sample app:

    ```bash
    cd $PROJECT_ROOT

    firebase init hosting
    ```

    Accept the defaults for all of the prompts.

1.  Replace `public/index.html` with the following:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Genkit demo</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="signin" hidden>
          <button id="signinBtn">Sign in with Google</button>
        </div>
        <div id="callGenkit" hidden>
          Subject: <input type="text" id="subject" />
          <button id="generatePoem">Compose a poem on this subject</button>
          <p id="generatedPoem"></p>
        </div>
        <script type="module">
          import { initializeApp } from 'https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/11.0.1/firebase-app.js';
          import {
            getAuth,
            onAuthStateChanged,
            GoogleAuthProvider,
            signInWithPopup,
          } from 'https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/11.0.1/firebase-auth.js';
          import { getFunctions, httpsCallable } from 'https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/11.0.1/firebase-functions.js';

          const firebaseConfig = await fetch('/__/firebase/init.json');
          initializeApp(await firebaseConfig.json());

          async function generatePoem() {
            const poemFlow = httpsCallable(getFunctions(), 'generatePoem');
            const subject = document.querySelector('#subject').value;
            const response = await poemFlow(subject);
            document.querySelector('#generatedPoem').innerText = response.data;
          }

          function signIn() {
            signInWithPopup(getAuth(), new GoogleAuthProvider());
          }

          document.querySelector('#signinBtn').addEventListener('click', signIn);
          document.querySelector('#generatePoem').addEventListener('click', generatePoem);

          const signinEl = document.querySelector('#signin');
          const genkitEl = document.querySelector('#callGenkit');

          onAuthStateChanged(getAuth(), (user) => {
            if (!user) {
              signinEl.hidden = false;
              genkitEl.hidden = true;
            } else {
              signinEl.hidden = true;
              genkitEl.hidden = false;
            }
          });
        </script>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

1.  Deploy the web app and Cloud Function:

    ```bash
    cd $PROJECT_ROOT

    firebase deploy
    ```

Open the web app by visiting the URL printed by the `deploy` command. The app
requires you to sign in with a Google account, after which you can initiate
endpoint requests.

## Optional: Run flows in the developer UI

You can run flows defined using `onCallGenkit` in the developer UI, exactly the
same way as you run flows defined using `defineFlow`, so there's no need to
switch between the two between deployment and development.

```bash
cd $PROJECT_ROOT/functions

genkit start -- npx tsx --watch src/index.ts
```

or

```bash
cd $PROJECT_ROOT/functions

npm run genkit:start
```

You can now navigate to the URL printed by the `genkit start` command to access.

## Optional: Developing using Firebase Local Emulator Suite

Firebase offers a
[suite of emulators for local development](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite), which you can
use with Genkit.

To use the Genkit Dev UI with the Firebase Emulator Suite, start the Firebase
emulators as follows:

```bash
genkit start -- firebase emulators:start --inspect-functions
```

This command runs your code in the emulator, and runs the Genkit framework in
development mode. This launches and exposes the Genkit reflection API (but not
the Dev UI).
