We'd love to hear about your experience with Genkit across all supported languages. Here's how you can get in touch with us:

## Community Resources

**Join the community:** Stay updated, ask questions, and share your work with other Genkit users on the [Genkit Discord server](https://discord.gg/qXt5zzQKpc).

**Provide feedback:** Report issues with Genkit or the docs, or suggest new features using our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/firebase/genkit/issues).

## What We'd Love to Hear

**We're interested in learning things like:**

- Was it straightforward to set up and make your first `generate()` call? If not, how could we make it better?

- Were you able to build what you wanted? If not, what could we do to help?

- Is there any specific feature, documentation, or resource that's missing?

- Is there anything that's working particularly well for you? Anything that isn't?

- How is your experience across different languages (JavaScript, Go, Python)?

- Anything else that you'd like to share with us about your experience!

## Language-Specific Feedback

We're particularly interested in feedback about:

- **Cross-language consistency**: How well do features work across JavaScript, Go, and Python?
- **Language-specific pain points**: Are there unique challenges in your preferred language?
- **Documentation clarity**: Is the unified documentation helpful for your language of choice?
- **Missing features**: Are there language-specific features you'd like to see?
