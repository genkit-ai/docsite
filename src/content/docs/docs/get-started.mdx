This guide shows you how to get started with Genkit in a Node.js app.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you're familiar with building applications with Node.js.

To complete this quickstart, make sure that your development environment meets
the following requirements:

- Node.js v20+
- npm

## Install Genkit dependencies

First, install the Genkit CLI globally. This provides command-line tools for working with Genkit, including the Developer UI:

```bash
npm install -g genkit-cli
```

Then, install the following Genkit dependencies in your project:

- `genkit` provides Genkit core capabilities.
- `@genkit-ai/googleai` provides access to the Google AI Gemini models.

```bash
npm install genkit @genkit-ai/googleai
```

## Configure your model API key

For this guide, we'll show you how to use the Gemini API which provides a
generous free tier and does not require a credit card to get started. To use the
Gemini API, you'll need an API key. If you don't already have one, create a key
in Google AI Studio.

  Get a Gemini API Key
</LinkButton>

After you've created an API key, set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable to your key:

```sh
export GEMINI_API_KEY=<your API key>
```

:::note
While this tutorial uses the Gemini API from AI Studio, Genkit supports a wide variety of model providers including Gemini from Vertex AI, Anthropic's Claude 3 models and Llama 3.1 through the Vertex AI Model Garden, open source models through Ollama, and several other community-supported providers like OpenAI and Cohere. See [Models supported by Genkit](/docs/models#models-supported-by-genkit) for details.

## Create your first flow

Get started with Genkit by creating a flow. Flows are special Genkit functions that provide end-to-end observability and rich debugging capabilities.

```ts
// import the Genkit and Google AI plugin libraries
import { googleAI } from '@genkit-ai/googleai';
import { genkit, z } from 'genkit';

// configure a Genkit instance
const ai = genkit({
  plugins: [googleAI()],
});

// Define schemas for input and output
const RecipeInputSchema = z.object({
  ingredient: z.string().describe('Main ingredient or cuisine type'),
  dietaryRestrictions: z.string().optional().describe('Any dietary restrictions'),
});

// Define a reusable recipe schema
const RecipeSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string(),
  description: z.string(),
  prepTime: z.string(),
  cookTime: z.string(),
  servings: z.number(),
  ingredients: z.array(z.string()),
  instructions: z.array(z.string()),
  tips: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
});

// Define a recipe generator flow
export const recipeGeneratorFlow = ai.defineFlow(
  {
    name: 'recipeGeneratorFlow',
    inputSchema: RecipeInputSchema,
    outputSchema: RecipeSchema,
  },
  async (input) => {
    // Create a prompt based on the input
    const prompt = `
      Create a recipe using ${input.ingredient} as the main ingredient
      ${input.dietaryRestrictions 
        ? `that is suitable for ${input.dietaryRestrictions} diets` 
        : ''}
    `.trim();

    // Generate structured recipe data using the same schema
    // Using a higher temperature (0.8) for more creative recipe ideas
    const { output } = await ai.generate({
      model: googleAI.model('gemini-2.0-flash', {
         temperature: 0.8 
      }),
      prompt,
      output: {
        schema: RecipeSchema,
      },
    });
    
    if (!output) {
      throw new Error('Failed to generate recipe - AI returned null output');
    }

    // Return the structured recipe
    return output;
  }
);

async function main() {
  // Call the flow with an ingredient
  const recipe = await recipeGeneratorFlow({ 
    ingredient: 'avocado', 
    dietaryRestrictions: 'vegetarian' 
  });
  
  // Display the recipe
  console.log(recipe);
}

main();
```

This example demonstrates how to:

1. Define reusable schemas for input and output
2. Create a flow that uses these schemas
3. Generate complex structured data using the same schema
4. Process and display the structured output in a useful way

Flows provide several advantages over direct function calls:
- Type safety with input and output schemas
- Integration with Genkit's developer UI for debugging
- Simplified deployment as web API endpoints
- End-to-end observability for your AI workflows

## Testing your flow in the Developer UI

One of the key benefits of flows is the ability to test and debug them using Genkit's Developer UI. This provides a visual interface for running flows, inspecting their execution, and understanding how they work.

### Starting the Developer UI

To start the Developer UI, run the following command from your project directory:

```bash
genkit start -- tsx --watch src/your-code.ts
```

This command starts the Developer UI and watches your TypeScript file for changes. The Developer UI is accessible at http://localhost:3400 by default.

### Running your flow

Once the Developer UI is running:

1. Navigate to the **Run** tab
2. Select the `recipeGeneratorFlow` from the list of available flows
3. Enter input values for your flow:
   ```json
   {
     "ingredient": "avocado",
     "dietaryRestrictions": "vegetarian"
   }
   ```
4. Click **Run Flow** to execute the flow

The Developer UI will execute your flow and display the results, including the structured recipe data.

### Inspecting the trace

After running your flow, you can inspect its execution trace:

1. Click **View trace** or navigate to the **Inspect** tab
2. Examine each step of the flow execution, including:
   - The input parameters
   - The prompt sent to the model
   - The model's response
   - The structured output

This trace view helps you understand how your flow processes data and interacts with the model, making it easier to debug and optimize your AI workflows.
