import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This page provides a guide for organizing folders and files in Mastra. Mastra is a modular framework, and you can use any of the modules separately or together.

You could write everything in a single file, or separate each component into their own files.

We donâ€™t enforce a specific folder structure, but we do recommend some best practices.

## Single file project

The simplest project structure to use with the Genkit is to place the Genkit instantiation and definition of all components into a single file. This may be sufficient for small and simple backends.

<FileTree>

- src
  - index.ts
- package.json
- tsconfig.json
- .env

</FileTree>

In this case, your index.ts file might look like this:

```ts
import { genkit, z } from 'genkit';
import { googleAI } from '@genkit-ai/googleai';

ai = genkit({ plugins: [googleAI()] })

const exampleFlow = ai.defineFlow({ 
    // Flow logic
});



```

## Modular project structure

For more complex backends that may include many Genkit components or Genkit components alongside other APIs.
