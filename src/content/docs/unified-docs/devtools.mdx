Genkit provides powerful developer tools that work consistently across JavaScript, Go, and Python:

- A command-line interface (CLI) for project operations
- A local web-based Developer UI for interactive testing and development
- Monitoring and observability features

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

The Genkit CLI provides essential commands for working with your AI applications. The CLI is shared across all languages and works the same way regardless of your implementation language.

### Installation

Install the CLI globally using npm (works for all languages):

```bash
npm install -g genkit-cli
```

### Starting the Developer UI

The core pattern is the same across all languages - provide an entrypoint command to run your application:

<LanguageContent lang="js">
```bash
    # Start the developer UI with your application
    genkit start -- <command to run your code>

    # Common examples:
    genkit start -- npm run dev
    genkit start -- npx tsx --watch src/index.ts
    genkit start -- node --watch src/index.js

    # Auto-open in browser
    genkit start -o -- npm run dev
    ```
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="go">
```bash
    # Start the developer UI with your Go application
    genkit start -- go run .
    genkit start -- go run main.go

    # Auto-open in browser
    genkit start -o -- go run .
    ```
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="python">
```bash
    # Start the developer UI with your Python application
    genkit start -- python app.py
    genkit start -- python main.py
    genkit start -- python -m your_module

    # Auto-open in browser
    genkit start -o -- python app.py
    ```
</LanguageContent>

After running the command, you'll see output like:

```bash
Telemetry API running on http://localhost:4033
Genkit Developer UI: http://localhost:4000
```

Open `http://localhost:4000` in your browser to access the Developer UI.

### Running Flows

Execute flows directly from the command line (works the same across all languages):

```bash
# Run a specified flow (your runtime must be running with GENKIT_ENV=dev)
genkit flow:run <flowName>

# Run with input data
genkit flow:run myFlow '{"input": "data"}'

# Batch run flows
genkit flow:batchRun <flowName> <inputFile.json>
```

### Evaluation Commands

<LanguageContent lang="js">
```bash
    # Evaluate a specific flow
    genkit eval:flow <flowName>

    # Evaluate with dataset
    genkit eval:flow myFlow --input myDataset.json

    # Extract evaluation data
    genkit eval:extractData <flowName> --output results.json

    # Run evaluation on extracted data
    genkit eval:run results.json
    ```
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="go">
```bash
    # Evaluate a specific flow
    genkit eval:flow <flowName>

    # Evaluate with dataset
    genkit eval:flow myFlow --input myDataset.json

    # Extract evaluation data
    genkit eval:extractData <flowName> --maxRows 100 --output results.json

    # Run evaluation on extracted data
    genkit eval:run results.json
    ```
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="python">
Evaluation commands are not yet available for Python. Use external evaluation tools or the Developer UI for testing.
</LanguageContent>

### Configuration Commands

```bash
# View all available commands
genkit --help

# Configure analytics opt-out
genkit config set analyticsOptOut true
genkit config get analyticsOptOut
```

## Genkit Developer UI

The Genkit Developer UI is a local web application that provides an interactive interface for working with models, flows, prompts, and other components. **The UI works identically across all languages** - once your application is running, the interface and features are the same.

### Features

The Developer UI provides action runners for various Genkit components:

- **Flow Runner**: Test and debug your AI workflows
- **Model Runner**: Experiment with different models and parameters  
- **Prompt Runner**: Test and iterate on prompts
- **Tool Runner**: Test function calling capabilities
- **Retriever Runner**: Test document retrieval systems
- **Indexer Runner**: Test document indexing operations
- **Embedder Runner**: Test text embedding generation
- **Evaluator Runner**: Run evaluation metrics on your outputs

### Interactive Testing

The Developer UI allows you to:

1. **Test flows interactively** - Run flows with different inputs and see results in real-time
2. **Experiment with models** - Try different model configurations and compare outputs
3. **Iterate on prompts** - Modify prompts and see immediate results
4. **Debug tool calling** - Test function calls and inspect their execution
5. **Analyze traces** - Inspect detailed execution traces for debugging
6. **Run evaluations** - Test your flows against evaluation datasets

### Trace Inspection

The Developer UI provides detailed trace inspection for all flow runs, allowing you to:

- View step-by-step execution details
- Inspect inputs and outputs at each stage
- Analyze performance metrics
- Debug errors and exceptions
- Compare different execution runs

This trace inspection works consistently across all languages, giving you the same debugging capabilities whether you're using JavaScript, Go, or Python.

## Monitoring and Observability

### Development Environment

When running in development mode (with `GENKIT_ENV=dev` or using `genkit start`), Genkit automatically:

- Enables trace collection
- Starts the telemetry API on `http://localhost:4033`
- Provides detailed debugging information
- Stores traces locally for inspection

This works the same way across all languages.

### OpenTelemetry Integration

<LanguageContent lang="js">
Genkit is fully instrumented with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) and provides hooks to export telemetry data to various monitoring systems.

    Configure telemetry export in your application:

    ```ts
    import { genkit } from 'genkit';
    import { googleAI } from '@genkit-ai/googleai';

    const ai = genkit({
      plugins: [googleAI()],
      telemetry: {
        instrumentation: 'genkit',
        logger: 'genkit',
      },
    });
    ```
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="go">
Genkit is fully instrumented with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) and provides hooks to export telemetry data.

    The [Google Cloud plugin](/go/docs/plugins/google-cloud) exports telemetry to Cloud's operations suite.

    ```go
    import (
        "github.com/firebase/genkit/go/genkit"
        "github.com/firebase/genkit/go/plugins/googlecloud"
    )

    func main() {
        ctx := context.Background()
        g, err := genkit.Init(ctx, 
            genkit.WithPlugins(&googlecloud.GoogleCloud{}),
        )
        // ...
    }
    ```

## Analytics and Privacy

The Genkit CLI and Developer UI use cookies and similar technologies from Google to deliver and enhance the quality of its services and to analyze usage. [Learn more](https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies).

### Opting Out of Analytics

To opt-out of analytics, run:

```bash
genkit config set analyticsOptOut true
```

You can view the current setting by running:

```bash
genkit config get analyticsOptOut
```

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow

1. **Start with the Developer UI** - Use the interactive interface to experiment with models and prompts
2. **Use watch mode** - Include `--watch` flags in your start commands to see changes immediately
3. **Test thoroughly** - Use the flow runner to test different input scenarios
4. **Monitor traces** - Inspect execution traces to understand performance and debug issues
5. **Evaluate regularly** - Use evaluation tools to measure and improve your AI application quality

### Debugging Tips

<LanguageContent lang="js">
- Use `console.log()` statements in your flows - they'll appear in the Developer UI
    - Check the trace inspector for detailed execution information
    - Use the model runner to isolate model-specific issues
    - Test prompts independently before integrating them into flows
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="go">
- Use `log.Printf()` for debugging output
    - Check traces in the Developer UI for execution details
    - Test individual components before integrating them
    - Use the monitoring features to track performance
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="python">
- Use `print()` statements for debugging
    - Test components individually in the Developer UI
    - Monitor application logs for errors and performance issues
</LanguageContent>

### Common Patterns

Regardless of your language, the development pattern is consistent:

1. **Start your application** with `genkit start -- <your-run-command>`
2. **Open the Developer UI** at `http://localhost:4000`
3. **Test components** using the various runners
4. **Inspect traces** to understand execution flow
5. **Iterate and improve** based on results
