Evaluation is a form of testing that helps you validate your LLM's responses and
ensure they meet your quality bar.

Genkit supports third-party evaluation tools through plugins, paired
with powerful observability features that provide insight into the runtime state
of your LLM-powered applications. Genkit tooling helps you automatically extract
data including inputs, outputs, and information from intermediate steps to
evaluate the end-to-end quality of LLM responses as well as understand the
performance of your system's building blocks.

## Types of evaluation

Genkit supports two types of evaluation:

- **Inference-based evaluation**: This type of evaluation runs against a
  collection of pre-determined inputs, assessing the corresponding outputs for
  quality.

  This is the most common evaluation type, suitable for most use cases. This approach tests a system's actual output for each evaluation run.

  You can perform the quality assessment manually, by visually inspecting the results. Alternatively, you can automate the assessment by using an evaluation metric.

- **Raw evaluation**: This type of evaluation directly assesses the quality of
  inputs without any inference. This approach typically is used with automated
  evaluation using metrics. All required fields for evaluation (e.g., `input`,
  `context`, `output` and `reference`) must be present in the input dataset. This
  is useful when you have data coming from an external source (e.g., collected
  from your production traces) and you want to have an objective measurement of
  the quality of the collected data.

  For more information, see the [Advanced use](#advanced-use) section of this page.

This section explains how to perform inference-based evaluation using Genkit.

## Quick start

### Setup

1. Use an existing Genkit app or create a new one by following the Getting started guide for your language:

<LanguageContent lang="js">
Follow the [Get started](/docs/get-started) guide.
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="go">
Follow the [Get started](/go/docs/get-started-go) guide.
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="python">
Evaluation features are not yet available for Python. You can use external evaluation tools with Python Genkit applications.
</LanguageContent>

2. Add the following code to define a simple RAG application to evaluate. For this guide, we use a dummy retriever that always returns the same documents.

<LanguageContent lang="js">
```js
    import { genkit, z, Document } from 'genkit';
    import { googleAI } from '@genkit-ai/googleai';

    // Initialize Genkit
    export const ai = genkit({ plugins: [googleAI()] });

    // Dummy retriever that always returns the same docs
    export const dummyRetriever = ai.defineRetriever(
      {
        name: 'dummyRetriever',
      },
      async (i) => {
        const facts = ["Dog is man's best friend", 'Dogs have evolved and were domesticated from wolves'];
        // Just return facts as documents.
        return { documents: facts.map((t) => Document.fromText(t)) };
      },
    );

    // A simple question-answering flow
    export const qaFlow = ai.defineFlow(
      {
        name: 'qaFlow',
        inputSchema: z.object({ query: z.string() }),
        outputSchema: z.object({ answer: z.string() }),
      },
      async ({ query }) => {
        const factDocs = await ai.retrieve({
          retriever: dummyRetriever,
          query,
        });

        const { text } = await ai.generate({
          model: googleAI.model('gemini-2.5-flash'),
          prompt: `Answer this question with the given context ${query}`,
          docs: factDocs,
        });
        return { answer: text };
      },
    );
    ```
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="go">
```go
    package main

    import (
        "context"
        "fmt"
        "log"

        "github.com/firebase/genkit/go/ai"
        "github.com/firebase/genkit/go/genkit"
        "github.com/firebase/genkit/go/plugins/googlegenai"
    )

    func main() {
        ctx := context.Background()

        // Initialize Genkit
        g, err := genkit.Init(ctx,
            genkit.WithPlugins(&googlegenai.GoogleAI{}),
            genkit.WithDefaultModel("googleai/gemini-2.5-flash"),
        )
        if err != nil {
            log.Fatalf("Genkit initialization error: %v", err)
        }

        // Dummy retriever that always returns the same facts
        dummyRetrieverFunc := func(ctx context.Context, req *ai.RetrieverRequest) (*ai.RetrieverResponse, error) {
            facts := []string{

                "Dogs have evolved and were domesticated from wolves",
            }
            // Just return facts as documents.
            var docs []*ai.Document
            for _, fact := range facts {
                docs = append(docs, ai.DocumentFromText(fact, nil))
            }
            return &ai.RetrieverResponse{Documents: docs}, nil
        }
        factsRetriever := genkit.DefineRetriever(g, "local", "dogFacts", dummyRetrieverFunc)

        genkit.DefineFlow(g, "qaFlow", func(ctx context.Context, query string) (string, error) {
            factDocs, err := ai.Retrieve(ctx, factsRetriever, ai.WithTextDocs(query))
            if err != nil {

    }
    ```

<LanguageContent lang="python">
Evaluation features are not yet available for Python. You can use external evaluation tools with Python Genkit applications.
</LanguageContent>

3. (Optional) Add evaluation metrics to your application to use while evaluating:

<LanguageContent lang="js">
This guide uses the `MALICIOUSNESS` metric from the `genkitEval` plugin.

    ```js
    import { genkitEval, GenkitMetric } from '@genkit-ai/evaluator';
    import { googleAI } from '@genkit-ai/googleai';

    export const ai = genkit({
      plugins: [
        googleAI(),
        // Add this plugin to your Genkit initialization block
        genkitEval({
          judge: googleAI.model('gemini-2.5-flash'),
          metrics: [GenkitMetric.MALICIOUSNESS],
        }),
      ],
    });
    ```

    **Note:** The configuration above requires installation of the [`@genkit-ai/evaluator`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@genkit-ai/evaluator) package.

    ```bash
    npm install @genkit-ai/evaluator
    ```
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="go">
This guide uses the `EvaluatorRegex` metric from the `evaluators` package.

    ```go
    import (
        "github.com/firebase/genkit/go/plugins/evaluators"
    )

    func main() {
        // ...

        metrics := []evaluators.MetricConfig{
            {
                MetricType: evaluators.EvaluatorRegex,
            },
        }

        // Initialize Genkit
        g, err := genkit.Init(ctx,
            genkit.WithPlugins(
                &googlegenai.GoogleAI{},
                &evaluators.GenkitEval{Metrics: metrics}, // Add this plugin
            ),
            genkit.WithDefaultModel("googleai/gemini-2.5-flash"),
        )
    }
    ```

    **Note:** Ensure that the `evaluators` package is installed in your go project:

    ```bash
    go get github.com/firebase/genkit/go/plugins/evaluators
    ```
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="python">
Not applicable - evaluation features are not yet available for Python.

4. Start your Genkit application:

<LanguageContent lang="js">
```bash
    genkit start -- <command to start your app>
    ```
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="go">
```bash
    genkit start -- go run main.go
    ```
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="python">

</LanguageContent>

### Create a dataset

Create a dataset to define the examples we want to use for evaluating our flow.

1. Go to the Dev UI at `http://localhost:4000` and click the **Datasets** button
   to open the Datasets page.

2. Click on the **Create Dataset** button to open the create dataset dialog.

   a. Provide a `datasetId` for your new dataset. This guide uses
   `myFactsQaDataset`.

   b. Select `Flow` dataset type.

   c. Leave the validation target field empty and click **Save**

3. Your new dataset page appears, showing an empty dataset. Add examples to it by following these steps:

   a. Click the **Add example** button to open the example editor panel.

   b. Only the `input` field is required. Add the input data:

<LanguageContent lang="js">
Enter `{"query": "Who is man's best friend?"}` in the `input` field, and click **Save** to add the example to your dataset.

    Repeat this process to add more examples:

    ```
    {"query": "Can I give milk to my cats?"}
    {"query": "From which animals did dogs evolve?"}
    ```
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="go">
Enter `"Who is man's best friend?"` in the `Input` field, and click **Save** to add the example to your dataset.

    If you have configured the `EvaluatorRegex` metric and would like to try it out, you need to specify a Reference string that contains the pattern to match the output against. For the preceding input, set the `Reference output` text to `"(?i)dog"`, which is a case-insensitive regular-expression pattern to match the word "dog" in the flow output.

    Repeat this process to add more examples:

    ```text
    "Can I give milk to my cats?"
    "From which animals did dogs evolve?"
    ```

    If you are using the regular-expression evaluator, use the corresponding reference strings:

    ```text
    "(?i)don't know"
    "(?i)wolf|wolves"
    ```
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="python">
Not applicable - evaluation features are not yet available for Python.
</LanguageContent>

By the end of this step, your dataset should have 3 examples in it, with the
values mentioned above.

### Run evaluation and view results

To start evaluating the flow, click the **Run new evaluation** button on your
dataset page. You can also start a new evaluation from the _Evaluations_ tab.

1. Select the `Flow` radio button to evaluate a flow.

2. Select `qaFlow` as the target flow to evaluate.

3. Select `myFactsQaDataset` as the target dataset to use for evaluation.

4. (Optional) If you have installed an evaluator metric using Genkit plugins,
   you can see these metrics in this page. Select the metrics that you want to use
   with this evaluation run. This is entirely optional: Omitting this step will
   still return the results in the evaluation run, but without any associated
   metrics.

5. Finally, click **Run evaluation** to start evaluation. Depending on the flow
   you're testing, this may take a while. Once the evaluation is complete, a
   success message appears with a link to view the results. Click on the link to go
   to the _Evaluation details_ page.

You can see the details of your evaluation on this page, including original
input, extracted context and metrics (if any).

## Core concepts

### Terminology

- **Evaluation**: An evaluation is a process that assesses system performance. In Genkit, such a system is usually a Genkit primitive, such as a flow or a
  model. An evaluation can be automated or manual (human evaluation).

- **Bulk inference** Inference is the act of running an input on a flow or model to get the corresponding output. Bulk inference involves performing inference on multiple inputs simultaneously.

- **Metric** An evaluation metric is a criterion on which an inference is scored. Examples include accuracy, faithfulness, maliciousness, whether the output is in English, etc.

- **Dataset** A dataset is a collection of examples to use for inference-based  
  evaluation. A dataset typically consists of `input` and optional `reference`
  fields. The `reference` field does not affect the inference step of evaluation
  but it is passed verbatim to any evaluation metrics. In Genkit, you can create a
  dataset through the Dev UI. There are two types of datasets in Genkit: _Flow_
  datasets and _Model_ datasets.

### Schema validation

Depending on the type, datasets have schema validation support in the Dev UI:

- Flow datasets support validation of the `input` and `reference` fields of the dataset against a flow in the Genkit application. Schema validation is optional and is only enforced if a schema is specified on the target flow.

- Model datasets have implicit schema, supporting both `string` and `GenerateRequest` input types. String validation provides a convenient way to evaluate simple text prompts, while `GenerateRequest` provides complete control for advanced use cases (e.g. providing model parameters, message history, tools, etc).

Note: Schema validation is a helper tool for editing examples, but it is
possible to save an example with invalid schema. These examples may fail when
running an evaluation.

## Supported evaluators

### Genkit evaluators

Genkit includes built-in evaluators to help you get started:

<LanguageContent lang="js">
Genkit includes a small number of native evaluators, inspired by [RAGAS](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/):

    - **Faithfulness** -- Measures the factual consistency of the generated answer against the given context
    - **Answer Relevancy** -- Assesses how pertinent the generated answer is to the given prompt
    - **Maliciousness** -- Measures whether the generated output intends to deceive, harm, or exploit
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="go">
Genkit includes a small number of built-in evaluators, ported from the [JS evaluators plugin](https://js.api.genkit.dev/enums/_genkit-ai_evaluator.GenkitMetric.html):

    - **EvaluatorDeepEqual** -- Checks if the generated output is deep-equal to the reference output provided.
    - **EvaluatorRegex** -- Checks if the generated output matches the regular expression provided in the reference field.
    - **EvaluatorJsonata** -- Checks if the generated output matches the [JSONATA](https://jsonata.org/) expression provided in the reference field.
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="python">
Evaluation features are not yet available for Python.
</LanguageContent>

### Evaluator plugins

Genkit supports additional evaluators through plugins:

<LanguageContent lang="js">
- [Vertex Rapid Evaluators](/docs/plugins/vertex-ai#evaluators) via the VertexAI Plugin
    - Custom evaluators through the plugin system
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="go">
- Custom evaluators through the plugin system
    - Third-party evaluation tools through plugins
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="python">
Not applicable - evaluation features are not yet available for Python.
</LanguageContent>

## Advanced use

### Evaluation comparison

The Developer UI offers visual tools for side-by-side comparison of multiple
evaluation runs. This feature allows you to analyze variations across different
executions within a unified interface, making it easier to assess changes in
output quality. Additionally, you can highlight outputs based on the performance
of specific metrics, indicating improvements or regressions.

When comparing evaluations, one run is designated as the _Baseline_. All other
evaluations are compared against this baseline to determine whether their
performance has improved or regressed.

<ThemeImage
  lightSrc="/src/assets/evals_compare_light.png"
  darkSrc="/src/assets/evals_compare_dark.png"
  alt="Evaluation comparison with metric highlighting"
/>

#### Prerequisites

To use the evaluation comparison feature, the following conditions must be met:

- Evaluations must originate from a dataset source. Evaluations from file
  sources are not comparable.
- All evaluations being compared must be from the same dataset.
- For metric highlighting, all evaluations must use at least one common
  metric that produces a `number` or `boolean` score.

#### Comparing evaluations

1. Ensure you have at least two evaluation runs performed on the same dataset.
   For instructions, refer to the
   [Run evaluation section](#run-evaluation-and-view-results).

2. In the Developer UI, navigate to the **Datasets** page.

3. Select the relevant dataset and open its **Evaluations** tab. You should see
   all evaluation runs associated with that dataset.

4. Choose one evaluation to serve as the baseline for comparison.

5. On the evaluation results page, click the **+ Comparison** button. If this
   button is disabled, it means no other comparable evaluations are available
   for this dataset.

6. A new column will appear with a dropdown menu. Select another evaluation
   from this menu to load its results alongside the baseline.

You can now view the outputs side-by-side to visually inspect differences in
quality. This feature supports comparing up to three evaluations simultaneously.

##### Metric highlighting (Optional)

If your evaluations include metrics, you can enable metric highlighting to
color-code the results. This feature helps you quickly identify changes in
performance: improvements are colored green, while regressions are red.

Note that highlighting is only supported for numeric and boolean metrics, and
the selected metric must be present in all evaluations being compared.

To enable metric highlighting:

1. After initiating a comparison, a **Choose a metric to compare** menu will
   become available.

2. Select a metric from the dropdown. By default, lower scores (for numeric
   metrics) and `false` values (for boolean metrics) are considered
   improvements and highlighted in green. You can reverse this logic by
   ticking the checkbox in the menu.

The comparison columns will now be color-coded according to the selected metric
and configuration, providing an at-a-glance overview of performance changes.

### Evaluation using the CLI

Genkit CLI provides a rich API for performing evaluation. This is especially
useful in environments where the Dev UI is not available (e.g. in a CI/CD
workflow).

Genkit CLI provides 3 main evaluation commands: `eval:flow`, `eval:extractData`,
and `eval:run`.

#### `eval:flow` command

The `eval:flow` command runs inference-based evaluation on an input dataset.
This dataset may be provided either as a JSON file or by referencing an existing
dataset in your Genkit runtime.

```bash
# Referencing an existing dataset
genkit eval:flow qaFlow --input myFactsQaDataset

# or, using a dataset from a file
genkit eval:flow qaFlow --input testInputs.json
```

Note: Make sure that you start your genkit app before running these CLI
commands.

<LanguageContent lang="js">
```bash
    genkit start -- <command to start your app>
    ```
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="go">
```bash
    genkit start -- go run main.go
    ```
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="python">
Not applicable - evaluation features are not yet available for Python.
</LanguageContent>

Here, `testInputs.json` should be an array of objects containing an `input`
field and an optional `reference` field:

<LanguageContent lang="js">
```json
    [
      {
        "input": { "query": "What is the French word for Cheese?" }
      },
      {
        "input": { "query": "What green vegetable looks like cauliflower?" },
        "reference": "Broccoli"
      }
    ]
    ```
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="go">
```json
    [
      {
        "input": "What is the French word for Cheese?"
      },
      {
        "input": "What green vegetable looks like cauliflower?",
        "reference": "Broccoli"
      }
    ]
    ```
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="python">
Not applicable - evaluation features are not yet available for Python.
</LanguageContent>

If your flow requires auth, you may specify it using the `--context` argument:

```bash
genkit eval:flow qaFlow --input testInputs.json --context '{"auth": {"email_verified": true}}'
```

By default, the `eval:flow` and `eval:run` commands use all available metrics
for evaluation. To run on a subset of the configured evaluators, use the
`--evaluators` flag and provide a comma-separated list of evaluators by name:

<LanguageContent lang="js">
```bash
    genkit eval:flow qaFlow --input testInputs.json --evaluators=genkitEval/maliciousness,genkitEval/answer_relevancy
    ```
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="go">
```bash
    genkit eval:flow qaFlow --input testInputs.json --evaluators=genkitEval/regex,genkitEval/jsonata
    ```
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="python">
Not applicable - evaluation features are not yet available for Python.
</LanguageContent>

You can view the results of your evaluation run in the Dev UI at
`localhost:4000/evaluate`.

#### `eval:extractData` and `eval:run` commands

To support _raw evaluation_, Genkit provides tools to extract data from traces
and run evaluation metrics on extracted data. This is useful, for example, if
you are using a different framework for evaluation or if you are collecting
inferences from a different environment to test locally for output quality.

You can batch run your Genkit flow and add a unique label to the run which then
can be used to extract an _evaluation dataset_. A raw evaluation dataset is a
collection of inputs for evaluation metrics, _without_ running any prior
inference.

Run your flow over your test inputs:

<LanguageContent lang="js">
```bash
    genkit flow:batchRun qaFlow testInputs.json --label firstRunSimple
    ```
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="go">
```bash
    genkit flow:batchRun qaFlow testInputs.json
    ```
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="python">
Not applicable - evaluation features are not yet available for Python.
</LanguageContent>

Extract the evaluation data:

<LanguageContent lang="js">
```bash
    genkit eval:extractData qaFlow --label firstRunSimple --output factsEvalDataset.json
    ```
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="go">
```bash
    genkit eval:extractData qaFlow --maxRows 2 --output factsEvalDataset.json
    ```
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="python">
Not applicable - evaluation features are not yet available for Python.
</LanguageContent>

The exported data has a format different from the dataset format presented
earlier. This is because this data is intended to be used with evaluation
metrics directly, without any inference step. Here is the syntax of the
extracted data.

```json
Array<{
  "testCaseId": string,
  "input": any,
  "output": any,
  "context": any[],
  "traceIds": string[],
}>;
```

The data extractor automatically locates retrievers and adds the produced docs
to the context array. You can run evaluation metrics on this extracted dataset
using the `eval:run` command.

```bash
genkit eval:run factsEvalDataset.json
```

By default, `eval:run` runs against all configured evaluators, and as with
`eval:flow`, results for `eval:run` appear in the evaluation page of Developer
UI, located at `localhost:4000/evaluate`.

### Batching evaluations

<LanguageContent lang="js">
:::note
    This feature is only available in the Node.js SDK.
    :::

    You can speed up evaluations by processing the inputs in batches using the CLI and Dev UI. When batching is enabled, the input data is grouped into batches of size `batchSize`. The data points in a batch are all run in parallel to provide significant performance improvements, especially when dealing with large datasets and/or complex evaluators. By default (when the flag is omitted), batching is disabled.

    The `batchSize` option has been integrated into the `eval:flow` and `eval:run` CLI commands. When a `batchSize` greater than 1 is provided, the evaluator will process the dataset in chunks of the specified size. This feature only affects the evaluator logic and not inference (when using `eval:flow`). Here are some examples of enabling batching with the CLI:

    ```bash
    genkit eval:flow myFlow --input yourDataset.json --evaluators=custom/myEval --batchSize 10
    ```

    Or, with `eval:run`

    ```bash
    genkit eval:run yourDataset.json --evaluators=custom/myEval --batchSize 10
    ```

    Batching is also available in the Dev UI for Genkit (JS) applications. You can set batch size when running a new evaluation, to enable parallelization.
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="go">
Batching features are not yet available for Go. Evaluations run sequentially.
</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="python">
Not applicable - evaluation features are not yet available for Python.
</LanguageContent>

### Custom extractors

<LanguageContent lang="js">
Genkit provides reasonable default logic for extracting the necessary fields
    (`input`, `output` and `context`) while doing an evaluation. However, you may
    find that you need more control over the extraction logic for these fields.
    Genkit supports customs extractors to achieve this. You can provide custom
    extractors to be used in `eval:extractData` and `eval:flow` commands.

    First, as a preparatory step, introduce an auxiliary step in our `qaFlow`
    example:

    ```js
    export const qaFlow = ai.defineFlow(
      {
        name: 'qaFlow',
        inputSchema: z.object({ query: z.string() }),
        outputSchema: z.object({ answer: z.string() }),
      },
      async ({ query }) => {
        const factDocs = await ai.retrieve({
          retriever: dummyRetriever,
          query,
        });
        const factDocsModified = await ai.run('factModified', async () => {
          // Let us use only facts that are considered silly. This is a
          // hypothetical step for demo purposes, you may perform any
          // arbitrary task inside a step and reference it in custom
          // extractors.
          //
          // Assume you have a method that checks if a fact is silly
          return factDocs.filter((d) => isSillyFact(d.text));
        });

        const { text } = await ai.generate({
          model: googleAI.model('gemini-2.5-flash'),
          prompt: `Answer this question with the given context ${query}`,
          docs: factDocsModified,
        });
        return { answer: text };
      },
    );
    ```

    Next, configure a custom extractor to use the output of the `factModified` step
    when evaluating this flow.

    If you don't have one a tools-config file to configure custom extractors, add
    one named `genkit-tools.conf.js` to your project root.

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/genkit/app

    touch genkit-tools.conf.js
    ```

    In the tools config file, add the following code:

    ```js
    module.exports = {
      evaluators: [
        {
          actionRef: '/flow/qaFlow',
          extractors: {
            context: { outputOf: 'factModified' },
          },
        },
      ],
    };
    ```

    This config overrides the default extractors of Genkit's tooling, specifically
    changing what is considered as `context` when evaluating this flow.

    Running evaluation again reveals that context is now populated as the output of
    the step `factModified`.

    ```bash
    genkit eval:flow qaFlow --input testInputs.json
    ```

    Evaluation extractors are specified as follows:

    - `evaluators` field accepts an array of EvaluatorConfig objects, which are
      scoped by `flowName`
    - `extractors` is an object that specifies the extractor overrides. The
      current supported keys in `extractors` are `[input, output, context]`. The
      acceptable value types are:
      - `string` - this should be a step name, specified as a string. The output
        of this step is extracted for this key.
      - `{ inputOf: string }` or `{ outputOf: string }` - These objects
        represent specific channels (input or output) of a step. For example, `{
    inputOf: 'foo-step' }` would extract the input of step `foo-step` for
        this key.
      - `(trace) => string;` - For further flexibility, you can provide a
        function that accepts a Genkit trace and returns an `any`-type value,
        and specify the extraction logic inside this function. Refer to
        `genkit/genkit-tools/common/src/types/trace.ts` for the exact TraceData
        schema.

    **Note:** The extracted data for all these extractors is the type corresponding
    to the extractor. For example, if you use context: `{ outputOf: 'foo-step' }`,
    and `foo-step` returns an array of objects, the extracted context is also an
    array of objects.

### Synthesizing test data using an LLM

<LanguageContent lang="js">
Here is an example flow that uses a PDF file to generate potential user
    questions.

    ```ts
    import { genkit, z } from 'genkit';
    import { googleAI } from '@genkit-ai/googleai';
    import { chunk } from 'llm-chunk'; // npm install llm-chunk
    import path from 'path';
    import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';
    import pdf from 'pdf-parse'; // npm install pdf-parse

    const ai = genkit({ plugins: [googleAI()] });

    const chunkingConfig = {
      minLength: 1000, // number of minimum characters into chunk
      maxLength: 2000, // number of maximum characters into chunk
      splitter: 'sentence', // paragraph | sentence
      overlap: 100, // number of overlap chracters
      delimiters: '', // regex for base split method
    } as any;

    async function extractText(filePath: string) {
      const pdfFile = path.resolve(filePath);
      const dataBuffer = await readFile(pdfFile);
      const data = await pdf(dataBuffer);
      return data.text;
    }

    export const synthesizeQuestions = ai.defineFlow(
      {
        name: 'synthesizeQuestions',
        inputSchema: z.object({ filePath: z.string().describe('PDF file path') }),
        outputSchema: z.object({
          questions: z.array(
            z.object({
              query: z.string(),
            }),
          ),
        }),
      },
      async ({ filePath }) => {
        filePath = path.resolve(filePath);
        // `extractText` loads the PDF and extracts its contents as text.
        const pdfTxt = await ai.run('extract-text', () => extractText(filePath));

        const chunks = await ai.run('chunk-it', async () => chunk(pdfTxt, chunkingConfig));

        const questions = [];
        for (var i = 0; i < chunks.length; i++) {
          const { text } = await ai.generate({
            model: googleAI.model('gemini-2.5-flash'),
            prompt: {
              text: `Generate one question about the following text: ${chunks[i]}`,
            },
          });
          questions.push({ query: text });
        }
        return { questions };
      },
    );
    ```

    You can then use this command to export the data into a file and use for
    evaluation.

    ```bash
    genkit flow:run synthesizeQuestions '{"filePath": "my_input.pdf"}' --output synthesizedQuestions.json
    ```
