We love it when the community gets involved in improving our docs!

## Setup

1. From the root directory of the repository, install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. From the root directory, serve the site locally:

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

   This command generates and serves the site on a
   local port (usually `localhost:4321`) that's printed to your terminal.

3. View your changes in the browser by navigating to <http://localhost:4321>.

4. Make your changes to the local repo. The site should automatically rebuild on most changes.

5. Commit your changes to the branch and submit your PR.
